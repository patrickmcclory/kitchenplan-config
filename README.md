## Patrick's dev environment setup

This is a pretty straightforward (honestly, rip-off) of the [Kitchenplan](https://github.com/kitchenplan/kitchenplan) and the example [Kitchenplan Config](https://github.com/roderik/kitchenplan-config).  My main goal was to get back up and running as soon as I could after resets and wipes of my machine either on purpose (e.g. I screwed it up) or as a result of the decisions of others (e.g. Genius bar debugging).

So what's here?  Here's the big hitlist of what I currently care about:

* AWS Developer Stuff
  * AWS Cli
  * Vagrant
  * Virtualbox
  * Packer
* Developer Stuff
  * Git
  * python tooling and setup
  * AWS CLI
  * Vagrant and VirtualBox
  * Kitematic
  * Sublime Text 3
  * Omnigraffle
* Blog admin stuff
  * Transmit
  * Git
  * Sublime Text 3
  * Jekyll Ruby Gem
* General Stuff
  * Google drive
  * Evernote
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Appcleaner
  * X-Mind
  * Lastpass
  * Snagit
  * Lastpass
  * Join.me
  * VMWare Fusion
  * Fonts that we use for presentations, etc.
